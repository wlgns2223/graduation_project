This Advanced Lane Detection project is Udacity self-driving car course
and usually is implemented by Python. 

I decided to develop a software for self-driving car for my graduation project 

and chose this topic as part of my project.

I chose C++ for this project because i like C++ and its powerful performance
and thought C/C++ is suitable for embedded software for vehicle.

I am going to apply Mask R-CNN to my project and will probaby change sample video
